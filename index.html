<h1>child birth</h1>
<p>This topic is all about child birth. here area few facts 
    When you are ready to have your baby, you'll go through labor. 
    Labor is the process of giving birth. Signs that you might be going into labor include:

Contractions that are regular then start to come closer together
Leaking fluid or bleeding from the vagina
Low, dull backache
Abdominal cramps
Call your health care provider if you have any of these signs, 
even if it is before your due date. Preterm labor can start before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy.

<h1>1. When you facilitate childbirth classes, there is a 
    lot of information that is shared over the course of the class time together. 
    Families are excited to learn all they can about the process and for 
    many this is the first peek into this subject matter. They are 
    amazed and excited at how the body 
    works and curious about how things will unfold.</h1>
    <h1>There are some fantastic facts about pregnancy, childbirth and their new baby, 
        that when shared, always gets a lot of "oohs" and "ahs" from everyone. 
        Here are my top ten amazing facts about the childbearing year.

    <title>The placenta is the body's only disposable organ</title>
    <h1>The placenta is made from the same cells that make the baby - sperm and egg. 
        Some cells differentiate into the baby and others go on to form the placenta. 
        The placenta does its job supporting and nourishing the baby and when it is no 
        longer needed, it is expelled, making it 
        the body's only disposable organ</h1>

<h1>Mothers and babies are monitored closely during labor. Most women are able to have a baby through 
    normal vaginal delivery. If there are complications, the baby 
    may need to be delivered surgically by a Cesarean section.</h1>
    <title>complications of child birth</title>
    <h1>Failure to progress.

        Often called “prolonged labor,” failure to progress generally describes a situation 
        in which active labor becomes protracted and stalls indefinitely. This could happen for a 
        variety of reasons, including having contractions that aren’t strong enough; a cervix 
        that’s stopped dilating; or a baby that is not descending down 
        the birth canal despite pushing.</h1>
        <h1>While obstetricians in recent years have acknowledged that women in labor don’t need 
            “to progress at a certain rate over time,” said Dr. Isaacs, your doctor may ultimately need to 
            intervene if your labor is at an impasse despite trying to move things along non-invasively. 
            This could mean a shot of medication called Pitocin (a synthetic hormone that can strengthen 
            and speed up uterine contractions), an episiotomy (a surgical incision made to enlarge the
             vaginal opening) or the use of forceps to help deliver the baby.

            But some medical interventions, such as Pitocin, can come with risks, including an increased 
            chance of a cesarean section (though the link between Pitocin and C-sections is being debated).
             Still, there has been a renewed focus on allowing women to labor longer — provided baby and 
             mother are healthy — to avoid unnecessary medical procedures and to make vaginal births safer.
            
            How to prevent it. Because the transition to the hospital can be stressful and jarring, 
            many practitioners recommended not rushing to the hospital at the very first sign of labor 
            (unless you’re high risk or are having another medical emergency). The further along you are 
            in labor before arriving at the hospital, said Dr. Isaacs, the more natural momentum your body
             will have to progress once you get there.

            <title>C-section</title>
            <h1>Cesarean section, C-section, or Cesarean birth is the surgical delivery of a baby through a cut (incision) made 
                in the mother's abdomen and uterus. Health care providers use it when they believe it is safer for the mother, the baby, or 
                both. The incision made in the skin may be: Up-and-down (vertical).</h1>
                <title>pain level</title>
                <h1>You won't feel any pain during the C-section, although you may feel sensations like pulling and pressure. 
                    Most women are awake and simply numbed from the waist down using regional anesthesia (an epidural and/or a 
                    spinal block) during a C-section. That way, they are awake to see and hear their baby being born.</h1>
